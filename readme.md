very basic projects just made to be made.
code is absolute spagetti
but who doesnt love a nice pasta every once and awhile!
these are all meant for [my site](https://novassite.net) and are just mostly stuff i want to hand over to the public
considering all the help i got from ripping code and reading what it does i feel like someone else could do the same with my code.
