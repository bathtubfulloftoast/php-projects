# root of diary
this is the root of the diary where youll find stuff thatd go in the root
if you wish to edit the theme of your own diary/journal you should edit `custom.css` for easy (easier) editing
if you want to edit in depth `style.css` is the main file.
jquery is also locally installed due to the fact this *should* be able to work offline considering its using php meaning youre probably hosting it yourself
